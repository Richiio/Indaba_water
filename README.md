The exponentially rising mortality rate brought on by drinking unclean water worries the Nigerian government.

According to research, the majority of Nigerians who reside in the country's rural areas lack access to clean drinking water and are not properly educated on the elements that make up safe water to use.

Access to safe drinking water is critical to health, a basic human right, and a vital component of effective health policy. This is an issue of national, regional, and local importance in terms of health and development. It has been demonstrated in some locations that investments in water supply and sanitation can result in a net economic benefit since the reductions in adverse health impacts and health-care expenses surpass the price of carrying out the interventions.
